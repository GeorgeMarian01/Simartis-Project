# About the project

During my training program at ITSchool, I had the opportunity to work on a significant project called "Simartis," which primarily focused on analyzing two of the Simartis web application's main functions and designing corresponding tests.

By reviewing the documentation, I gained a thorough understanding of the application's technical specifications. Moving into the test design phase, I created a variety of test cases, including functional, acceptance, and system tests, to cover all possible scenarios. Each test case was meticulously crafted, taking into account different user interactions and potential edge cases.

**The Simartis project is available on the Atlassian Jira platform.**
